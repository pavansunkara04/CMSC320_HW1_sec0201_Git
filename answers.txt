Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using git because we need to be able to track 
history of code changes so that reciepts are kept for everything that is 
important for code. Additionally, git is a great way to ensure seamless 
collaboration on the same code if multiple people are working on the same 
exact code.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to healthcare. In healthcare, data 
science can help improve the process in which medicine is produced, and can 
even be used to diagnose diseases in patients and figure out how to deal with 
these diseases in these patients best.


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that when we merge, we 
combine the commits across several different branches into a single branch, 
whereas with rebasing, we take our commits and put them on top of another 
branch to make it seem as if all of the changes were made in the same exact 
codebase.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to diving deep into the data science. This course 
is the first experience that I have had with data science, so I'm really 
looking forward to learning a computer science concept that's a bit different 
from what I'd been working on recently.
