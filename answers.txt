Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using git because we need to be able to track 
history of code changes so that reciepts are kept for everything that is 
important for code. Additionally, git is a great way to ensure seamless 
collaboration on the same code if multiple people are working on the same 
exact code.
